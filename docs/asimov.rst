Using cogwheel with asimov
==========================

Asimov is able to automate cogwheel analyses using its common analysis description interface.

In order to set up a cogwheel job using asimov you'll need to first create an asimov project, and add an event to your project which you'll perform the analysis on.

We've included some quick instructions for doing this here, but you can find more a more comprehensive `tutorial<https://asimov.docs.ligo.org/asimov/master/getting-started.html>`_ in the asimov documentation.
